## Cyclr Documentation

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cyclr/docs/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll

3. On your local computer, clone the Git repository for the Jekyll site:
```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cyclr/docs.git
```
4. Start up the application:
```Shell
