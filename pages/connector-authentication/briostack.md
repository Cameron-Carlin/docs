Briostack Setup
---------------
In order to authenticate the connector, you will simply need your username, password and account name.

Your account name can be found in the address of your website, for example if your site is __johnsmithltd.briostack.com__, your account name would be __johnsmithltd__.

Sales Methods
---------------
Within the Sales methods, you can select a category, to return only those sales which fall within it, or return all sales by leaving the field blank.

Customers
---------------
It is not currently possible to filter the customers by business sector, so for most use cases, "List Customers" would not be a practical method.  As a result, Get Customer has been provided for returning individual customer records.
