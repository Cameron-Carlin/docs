Drip Setup
---------------
In order to authenticate the connector, you will need your Client ID and Client Secret.  You get these by setting up an Application within Drip.

**Setting up an Application**
1. Go to https://www.getdrip.com/user/applications, choose a name for your application, and click "Create Application".
2. In Callback URL, put ht<span></span>tps://yoursubdomain.cyclr.com/connector/callback (replacing yoursubdomain with your actual subdomain, for example johnsmithcompany-h)
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret for use in setting up the connector.
4. Click Save, and then Activate.
5. You should now be able to authenticate the connector.
