## What is a Cyclr custom connector?

A custom connector allows you to integrate apps that aren’t in our [connector library](http://cyclr.com/connectors/). You can even add connectors for your own private apps and websites. Our Connector Manager makes this task quicker and easier to maintain than writing a traditional coded integration.  Note that not all price plans include access to the Custom Connector builder or that access is subject to an additional fee

A connector a standardised definition in a propriatory Cyclr format of the methods and fields of an API. Once created Cyclr takes care of everthing that is needed to work with an API including:

| Property | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Descrption | Name, description version etc. |
| Authentication | How the connector should connect to the target API (e.g. OAuth, API key, login, etc). |
| Rate limiting & Throttling | How frequetly it is allowed to make calls to the API. |
| Methods | The endpoints for the API. |


If available in your console, access to Custom Connectors is available in the Console under 'Connectors'.
