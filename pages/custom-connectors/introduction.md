## What is a custom connector?

A custom connector allows you to integrate apps that aren’t in our [connector library](http://cyclr.com/connectors/). You can even add connectors for your own private apps and websites. Our Connector Manager makes this task quicker and easier to maintain than writing a traditional coded integration.  Note that not all price plans include access to the Custom Connector builder or that access is subject to an additional fee

A connector a standardised definition in a propriatory Cyclr format of the methods and fields of an API. Once created Cyclr takes care of much of the ‘grunge’ of working with an API including:

*   Authentication
*   Paging
*   Rate limiting / throttling
*   Error handling

If available in your console, access to Custom Connectors is available in the Console under 'Connectors'.
