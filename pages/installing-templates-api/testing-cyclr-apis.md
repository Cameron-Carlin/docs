Cyclr has several API references for you to test while creating your own native deployment or working with data on demand. 

In order to select the right version of our API reference you need to ensure you select the version that corisponds to your Cyclr Console's hosting location.

Cyclr Console Location | Documentation link
--- | ---
US (eg: my.cyclr.com) | [US API Reference](https://api.cyclr.com/docs/index)
UK (eg: my.cyclr.uk) | [UK API Reference](https://api.cyclr.uk/docs/index)
EU (eg: eu.cyclr.com | [EU API Reference](https://api.eu.cyclr.com/docs/index)


You can use your Cyclr account details to authenticate access, giving you the ability to test all endpoints, with Cyclr account data, directly within the API reference documentation. 

Click on the "OFF" toggle switch within a method, as shown below, to trigger the authentication pop up.
