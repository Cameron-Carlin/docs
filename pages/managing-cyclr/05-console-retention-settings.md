## Data Retention 

The data retention settings allow you to specify how long both successful transactions and transaction errors should be retained.
 
By default both are set to retain data to thirty days.
 
Retention for Successful Transactions and Errored Transactions can be turned off, and adjusted independently of each other, and the retention period can be set in Hours, Days, or Weeks.
