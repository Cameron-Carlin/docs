If you require one of your clients to authenticate an Account Connector, but they don't have access to Cyclr and don't wish to share their credentials with you, you can generate a **Connector Authentication Link**.

This is a link that can be emailed and will take anyone clicking it through the authentication screens of a particular Account Connector.

To generate a Connector Authentication Link:

* go to your Cyclr Console then the **Accounts** menu and **Account Management**.
* click the **Users** button by the relevant Account.
* click the **User Settings** button next to an appropriate user.
* scroll down to the **Accounts** section showing what the user has access to and click the **Connector Authentication Link** button.
* select the Acount Connector from the dropdown and set a date for the Link Expires After value and click Generate.

You'll then be given a URL you can send to someone to authenticate the Account Connector.

*Note: This link will only function **once** so after being clicked the first time, the link will no longer work.*
