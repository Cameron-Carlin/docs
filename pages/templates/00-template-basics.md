## Cyclr Templates

You can build Templated integrations in Cyclr that can then be either manually installed to your client's account or offered to clients for self installation.

When you select the 'Design New Template' option from within Templates>Template Library you will be taken directly to Cyclr's builder tool.  In order to keep your Cyclr's console tidy and well organised the first thing that you are recommended to do is to give the Template a good name.
