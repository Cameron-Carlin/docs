## Basics

In order to use build a Cyclr template you need to install connectors. You can do this from the template builder.  If this is your first template you will be directed to the connector store in order to get started.

If you need further connectors these can be added from the the right sidebar of the builder.  There are two types of connector avaiable.  Application connectors work with many popular SaaS applications.  Utility connectors are provided to help in the constructon of your integratons.

If you want to test a template you will need to authenticate it in order to allow Cyclr to connect. If you’re just experimenting, you can skip this step and install with the connector without authentication.

### Authenticating a Connector

There are different types of authentication. Depending on the connector you wish to use, the application may require any of the following:

*   Oauth – login using your account and give permissions
*   An API key
*   Username and password
*   No authentication, e.g. for webhooks

The connector installer will take you through the steps in order to authenticate.

Once you have authenticated your connectors, you will be returned to the builder. Your new connectors will be installed in the sidebar ready to use.
